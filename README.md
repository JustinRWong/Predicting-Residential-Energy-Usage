## Abstract
Global climate change continues to increase the demand of energy consumption over time as temperatures and weather patterns are more extreme. Increasing demands have led to the need for increasing energy capacity and distribution for customers. In this study, we develop a machine learning model to predict residential energy consumption in the Bay Area geographic zip codes based on meteorological data, such as temperature, humidity, near infrared, and weather. Historic residential energy consumption data from PG&E and NREL National Solar Radiation data will serve as our validation data. We seek to develop a generalizable model so that such inputs can be applied to other geographic locations outside the Bay Area. Such a model serves as key to ensuring efficient operations of residential energy systems as climate change takes its course.

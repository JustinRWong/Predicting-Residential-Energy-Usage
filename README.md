## Abstract
Global climate change continues to increase the demand of energy consumption over time as temperatures and weather patterns are more extreme. Increasing demands have led to the need for increasing energy capacity and distribution for customers. In this study, we developed a machine learning model to predict residential energy consumption in the Bay Area geographic zip codes based on meteorological data, such as temperature, humidity, near infrared, and weather. Historic residential energy consumption data from PG&E and NREL National Solar Radiation data served as our validation data. We sought to develop a generalizable model so that such inputs can be applied to other geographic locations outside the Bay Area. The KNN model performed the best based on the evaluation of mean squared error (MSE) values. Such a model serves as key to ensuring efficient operations of residential energy systems as climate change takes its course.

## Focus of This Study 

This study used machine learning and modeling methods to predict the scale of energy consumption increase based on past climate data. For this study, we specifically looked at residential energy usage in kilowatt-hours (kWh). We predicted the scale of energy consumption applicable to the Bay Area, California which can be used to plan increasing energy capacity across utilities, storage, etc.
